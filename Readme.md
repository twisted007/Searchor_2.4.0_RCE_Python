This is just a quick script to exploit webservers running the vulnerable version of Searchor.

This script will accept a hostname, the attacker's IP address and the attacker's Port number.
It is recommended to use `rlwrap nc -lvnp <Port_Number>` when preparing to catch the reverse shell.

Additional details about the vulnerability can be found in the issue history for [Searchor](https://github.com/ArjunSharda/Searchor/pull/130).
